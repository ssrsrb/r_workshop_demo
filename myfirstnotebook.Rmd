# Final Exercise software carpentry 2017-08-27

1. Import necessary packages
```{r loadlibraries}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trestletech/shinyAce")
devtools::install_github("swarm-lab/editR")

library(editR)
```

2. Read in data set
```{r readdataset}
setwd('c:/Users/reissb/SDC_workshop_20170826/intro-r-20170825/')

gapminder.base <- read.csv(file ='datasets/gapminder_backup.txt',header=TRUE, sep ='\t')
gapminder <- read_delim('../intro-r-20170825/datasets/gapminder_backup.txt','\t',escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)


```



3.  Explore gapminder dataset
    1.    Get summary statistics for gapminder variables
```{r explore datasets}     
summary(gapminder)
```
    2. Peek at the first 6 rows of gapminder
```{r head}
head(gapminder)
```
4. Manipulate gapminder to answer questions
    1.  Which country has the highest gdp per capita, and in what year?
```{r highestgdppercapita}
gapminder %>% filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap)) %>% select(country, year)

```
    2. What is the lowest life expectancy in the gapminder data set and what country had it?
```{r lowestlifeexpectancy}    
gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp == min(lifeExp)) %>% select(country) 

```
    3. ADVANCED: How many countries have ever had a life expectancy lower than 50
```{r Ncountrieslifeexp<50}
gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp < 50) %>% select(country) %>% unique() %>% nrow()
```
    4. ADVANCED: How many total countries are there listed in Asia?
```{r NAsia}
gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Asia') %>% select(country) %>% unique() %>% nrow()
```
    5. Make a new column that has the gdp (instead of gdpPercap) Hint: multiply gdpPercap by pop to get gdp.
```{r newCol gdp}
gapminder %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop )
  
```
    
5. Loops & if else
    1. Create a loop that goes through each row and evaluates whether the population is above, below, or at the mean population.
            Initialize a column, called RelationToMeanPop with NA values (syntax: df$newColumnName <- NA)
            for each row of 1:nrow(gapminder2)

```{r loopaboveorbelowmean population}
gapminder %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(RelationToMeanPop<-NA)

```
    2. if gapminder2$pop[row] > mean(gapminder2$pop), assign Above to gapminder2$RelationToMeanPop[row]
            else if gapminder2$pop[row] < mean(gapminder2$pop), assign Below to gapminder2$RelationToMeanPop[row]
            else if gapminder2$pop[row] == mean(gapminder2$pop), assign At to gapminder2$RelationToMeanPop[row]
            else go to the next loop using next.
            
```{r if}
gapminder %>% group_by(year) %>% mutate(yearmean = mean(pop)) %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate( RelationToMeanPop = ifelse(pop > yearmean,'Above',ifelse(pop<yearmean,'Below','At' ) ) ) %>% 
  select(year, RelationToMeanPop) %>% 
  table()


```
            
        Run this for loop. Don't forget to check your work by looking at the RelationToMeanPop column
        Use table(gapminder2$RelationToMeanPop) to find out how many fit into each group.
   
   
   
    Plots
        Create a plot with x=year, y=lifeExp, and color by continent. Use geom_smooth() to create a line to view life expectancy by year. Answer the following questions using the plot (you can verify by running some code).
            What continent has the highest life expectancy?
            What continent has the lowest life expectancy?
            On what continents has the life expectancy been increasing or decreasing over time?
        Create a plot with x=continent, y=gdpPercap, and fill by continent. Use geom_boxplot() to create a boxplot for each continent. Use the plot to answer the following questions
            Which continent tends to have the lowest gross domestic product (gdp)?
            Which continent tends to have the highest gdp?
            Which continent has the country with the highest gdp?
